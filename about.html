	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>This project embarks on an innovative exploration of email spam detection, leveraging Python to redefine the standards of accuracy and efficiency in spam filtering systems. By rigorously comparing the capabilities of advanced large language models (LLMs) with traditional machine learning algorithms, we unveil a new era in spam detection. Our investigation spans a diverse range of LLM families, including BERT-like models, Sentence Transformers, and Seq2Seq architectures, set against well-established methods like Na√Øve Bayes and LightGBM. Through meticulous experimentation across four public datasets, we assess these models in both extensive and few-shot learning scenarios.</p>
